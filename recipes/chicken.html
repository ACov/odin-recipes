                garlic press you can finely chop the cloves instead.  Add pressed/chopped garlic to
                your other ingredients.

                Flip chicken over halfway through to be sure both sides are covered evenly.

            <li>Cook chicken as you would normally, prefereably by barbequeing it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
